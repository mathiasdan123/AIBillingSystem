Session Duration: 45 minutes (Skilled 1:1)
S: Subjective
Child entered session with positive affect and moderate energy level. Parent reported continued
challenges with dressing and coordination, especially during transitions. Teacher shared
concerns regarding balance and clumsiness during recess activities. Child verbalized
excitement for “climbing and swinging” and stated,
“I want to do the zipline today.
”
O: Objective
Total skilled therapy time: 45 minutes (direct 1:1 interaction in sensory gym)
●
●
●
Child completed a core strengthening obstacle course including animal walks, scooter
board pulls, and climbing onto varied surfaces. Therapist provided verbal cues and
physical prompts to support postural control and trunk stability throughout.
Participated in dynamic movement and balance tasks such as using a balance beam,
stepping stones, and suspended equipment (e.g., swing and trapeze bar). Activities
were structured to challenge motor planning, bilateral coordination, and body awareness
while receiving graded vestibular and proprioceptive input.
Engaged in dressing-related fine and gross motor simulations including donning shoes
and jackets from the floor position, fastening/unfastening zippers and buttons, and
organizing task steps. Therapist used visual supports and sequencing strategies to
●
support independence.
Practiced coordination and ADL readiness skills through sensory-motor games requiring
midline crossing, hand-eye coordination (e.g., catching weighted balls while seated on a
therapy ball), and self-regulation strategies such as deep pressure and heavy work.
Child required moderate cues for attention, postural adjustments, and sequencing.
Demonstrated improved endurance and engagement compared to previous sessions.
Maintained interest and motivation throughout with minimal redirection.
A: Assessment
Child presents with decreased core strength, impaired motor planning, and limited postural
stability impacting participation in age-appropriate self-care and gross motor tasks. Skilled
therapy remains medically necessary to build foundational motor and sensory processing skills
required for safe and independent functioning in both home and school settings. The sensory
gym environment supports meaningful engagement and provides controlled, therapeutic input
for developing coordination and body awareness.
P: Plan
●
●
●
●
Continue 2x/week OT in sensory gym with focus on:
○
Core and upper body strengthening to support dressing and classroom posture
○
Motor planning and coordination tasks to improve playground and ADL
performance
○
Sequencing and bilateral tasks for fine motor dressing readiness
○
Integration of regulation tools into therapy and home routine
Progress to more complex multi-step ADL simulations over next 2–3 sessions
Update home program with therapist-guided activities for carryover
Reassess with clinical observation and goal review in 4 weeks
